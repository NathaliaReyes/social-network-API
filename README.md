# ü´Çsocial-network-API 
Project related to mongoDB and mongoose.

## Description
This project, titled "Social-Network-API", is a backend application built with Express.js, and MongoDB, a NoSQL database. The use of MongoDB allows the application to efficiently handle large amounts of unstructured data, making it ideal for a social networking web application. The application also uses Mongoose ODM for powerful data modeling and schema enforcement. It's designed to provide API endpoints where users can share their thoughts, react to friends‚Äô thoughts, and create a friend list.

## Installation

To install this application, you'll need Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <https://github.com/NathaliaReyes/social-network-API.git>` or `git clone <git@github.com:NathaliaReyes/social-network-API.git>`.
2. Navigate to the cloned repository in your terminal `cd social-network-API`.
3. Be sure to have MongoDB installed on your machine.
4. Install the necessary npm packages by running `npm install`.
5. Seed the database, `npm run seed`.
6. Start the application by running `npm run start` in your terminal.

Please refer to the `Usage` section for more details on how to use the application.

## Usage

This application is a backend server and does not have a frontend UI. To test and interact with this application, you will need to use an API testing tool like Postman.

A Postman collection that includes all the API endpoints for this application is provided in the `assets` folder. Here's how you can use it:

1. Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) on your local machine.
2. Run the server for this application.
3. Open Postman and click on 'Import' to import the collection file from the `assets` folder.
4. Once the collection is imported, you can click on each request to see the details and send the request to the server.

Remember to replace `<port>` in the request URLs with the actual port number where your server is running.
